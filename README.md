# Monster Battle Game
Monster Battle Game is a turn-based strategy game where players select and command a team of elemental monsters to battle against a computer-controlled opponent. Drawing inspiration from the classic Pok√©mon games, players must strategically choose from a roster of 20 unique monsters, each belonging to one of five elemental types: Wind, Water, Fire, Plant, and Earth.


## Game Rules
1. **Monster Selection:**
    - The player selects 3 monsters from a pool of 20.
    - The computer also selects 3 monsters randomly from the same pool.
2. **Battle System:**
    - Battles are turn-based, where each player (human or computer) takes turns selecting a monster and using an ability.
    - Each monster has a set of abilities that deal damage or provide other effects (e.g., healing, status changes).
    - A monster is knocked out when its HP (Health Points) reaches 0.
    - The battle continues until all monsters on one side are knocked out.
3. **Turn Order:**
    - The AI starts off the game and alternates between AI and Player.
4. **Winning the Game:**
    - The game is won when all of the opponent's monsters are knocked out.
